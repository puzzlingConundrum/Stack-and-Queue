# Stack-and-Queue
A simple stack and queue implementation from scratch in Java along with a main class to test the implementation.
The stack has the following methods: size(), isEmpty(), push(), pop(), top(), and toString().
The queue has the following methods: size(), isEmpty(), enqueue(), dequeue(), first(), toString().

The stack and queue are both implemented using a Node class which functions in a similar manner to a node in a linked list.
